# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my LeetCode problem solutions written in **Python** (and later **Go**).

The goal is to:
- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Write clean, efficient code
- Practice data structures and algorithms

## Problem: Two Sum

### Problem Summary

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`,  
return the **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

- Each input has exactly one valid solution.
- The same element cannot be used twice.
- The answer can be returned in any order.

#### Example 1
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9

#### Example 2

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

#### Example 3

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

### Constraints

- `2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁴`
- `-10⁹ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹`
- `-10⁹ ≤ target ≤ 10⁹`
- Only one valid answer exists
